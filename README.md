# Flexible Classifier Pipeline

This repository contains a flexible classifier pipeline that can be used to train and evaluate classification models on various datasets. The pipeline is designed to be versatile and easily adaptable to different datasets and classification tasks.

## Overiew

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The pipeline preprocesses the input data, handling missing values, scaling numerical features and encoding categorical features as necessary.
2. **Classification Model**: Function tries variety of classification models to use in the pipeline, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines.
3. **Cross-Validation**: The pipeline performs cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model on the given dataset. This helps in assessing the generalization ability of the model and avoiding overfitting.
